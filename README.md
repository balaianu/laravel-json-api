## What is JSON API?

From [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)

> If you've ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON API is your 
anti-bikeshedding weapon.
>
> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus 
on what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage of its features around 
efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

For full information on the spec, plus examples, see [http://jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org).
